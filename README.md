Vehicle electrification in the transportation sector is an emerging and effective solution to reduce carbon footprint and mitigate environmental and climatic impacts. Despite the fact that the U.S. has arguably lagged and is increasing the effort in decarbonization in recent years, EV in U.S. and especially in California has received increased attention from general public and stakeholder groups. 
 

The team has collected California EV registration data. The Data Analysis and Modeling task is to develop a spatial temporal model for estimation and prediction of EV adoption (i.e., number of registered EVs) at the U.S. County level. 

Data sources
1. California EV registration data (CA_EV_registration.csv, in the attached ZIP), temporal spatial aggregation needed
2. Vehicle charging station data (EV_Chargers_Last_updated_03-20-2023_ada.xlsx attached ZIP): number of different types of EV chargers in each county in California.
3. Counties GIS shapefile in California (CA_Counties.zip attached ZIP) 
4. American Community Survey on California income, population, etc. available here: https://dof.ca.gov/reports/demographic-reports/american-community-survey/#ACS2020x5
